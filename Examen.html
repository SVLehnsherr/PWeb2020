                The mythical Billy returns, the fish who became so famous
                because he sings and moves in a super fun way. Now he's back
                with his one an only rendition of Gloria Gaynor's hit song "I
                will survive."
                You can hang it from a parted thanks to its two upper holes on
                the back or standing on any surface with the easel that it has
                on the back.

                If you don't know Billy, we'll introduce him to you. It is a fish
                with a vocation for a singer that is on a plate. When you push
                the button on the license plate, Billy starts singing the song "I
                will survive" and moves as he sings it. In addition, at the back
                you can activate the motion sensor which will make when
                someone passes in front of Billy, star singing.
